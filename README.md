ðŸŒ³ FH MUTUAL AID SUMMARY OF ACTION SO FAR ðŸŒ³

Yesterday a couple of us had a think about how to help organise the information shared thus far in the WhatsApp group. Below is what we have collated and here is the link to this in the drive : [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aaTH5ZKUl11Vc7yj015ZugfqJtzWuUL5bd6mzHELgto](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aaTH5ZKUl11Vc7yj015ZugfqJtzWuUL5bd6mzHELgto) 

ðŸŒ³ SUB-GROUPS ðŸŒ³

Various people have been setting up smaller groups linked to specific areas or streets, to make it easier to manage and help those in need (close by to us).  You can find all the groups on this map and join their individual WhatsApp groups: https://tiny.cc/o8mflz 

If the area you're in isn't covered by the map, feel free to set up a Whatapp group for it. The map is editable by anyone and there are instructions on how to start a group it if you need them - just ask.

Here is a guide for updating the shared map: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FZaL29t5Yo9nUdQymySsJfBG2pg8PA9I93ZmxRm7cPs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FZaL29t5Yo9nUdQymySsJfBG2pg8PA9I93ZmxRm7cPs/edit?usp=sharing) . Note that you can only add to the map from a computer, not your phone

**ACTION: Could we suggest that there is a named lead for each subgroup that gives an update to the main FH whatsapp every other day or once a day? **

ðŸŒ³ FLYERING ðŸŒ³

Initially individual members distributed leaflets in their local streets and this was marked on a map by submitting a google form with what postcodes had been completed. Found here: [https://se23map.weebly.com](https://se23map.weebly.com) 

Leaflet template is here: [http://bit.ly/Flyer_Template](http://bit.ly/Flyer_Template) 

So far people have been using their own telephone numbers. 

ðŸŒ³ RESOURCES ðŸŒ³

There's a shared google drive, to collate ideas, plans, different working group/task areas: [http://bit.ly/ForestHillAid](http://bit.ly/ForestHillAid)

ðŸŒ³ COMMUNICATION ðŸŒ³

The WhatsApp messages have been very high in volume, in other groups they have created a parallel social WhatsApp group to chat and combat isolation, which could leave the main Forest Hill WhatsApp group free for important information sharing only. 

**ACTION**: I**f the majority of people think this is worthwhile doing, could someone take this on as a role and create another social group? **

ðŸŒ³ NEW JOINERS ðŸŒ³

**ACTION: If new people join the group could someone copy and paste this message or the link to the google drive:  **[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aaTH5ZKUl11Vc7yj015ZugfqJtzWuUL5bd6mzHELgto](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aaTH5ZKUl11Vc7yj015ZugfqJtzWuUL5bd6mzHELgto) 

And a message saying something like: 

_W E L C O M E_

_Hello to everyone who has joined the group, couple of things._

_No1: to volunteer PLEASE visit this welcome document ([https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aaTH5ZKUl11Vc7yj015ZugfqJtzWuUL5bd6mzHELgto](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aaTH5ZKUl11Vc7yj015ZugfqJtzWuUL5bd6mzHELgto)) and join up via the latest flying map ([https://tiny.cc/o8mflz](https://tiny.cc/o8mflz))_

_ðŸ’¬ðŸ“¢ This whatsapp is for Key messages for the community & volunteers here_

_No2: ðŸ¥³ Social Channel to combat isolation is below : X_

_Stay well xXx_

**ACTION: Would a basic website with a page for each sub group be helpful? This is quick and easy to set up on weebly or word press. Volunteers please raise your hand! **

ðŸŒ³ SAFEGUARDING ðŸŒ³

Online safeguarding training happening today, especially for Mutual Aid groups:

ðŸŒ³ SAFETY ADVICE ðŸŒ³

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kdyZjXapKSFIsFrRBDGC_9kW4rOiQzJl-lhCmQRZwk8/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kdyZjXapKSFIsFrRBDGC_9kW4rOiQzJl-lhCmQRZwk8/edit) 

ðŸŒ³ TO BE DISCUSSED AND DECISIONS MADE... ðŸŒ³

**The volunteer sign up form:** This was used a few days ago, and there is an excel sheet populated with X amount of volunteer details. We need to decide whether to keep this, or leave it to subgroups to match volunteers with people who need assistance. Currently Kasia has access to this document. 

**Dispatching help**: Outlining the ways in which subgroups are matching volunteers with people who need assistance. This can then be shared amongst all subgroups. 

**Data Protection**: How to make sure the sensitive data is safe? Here is the Data Privacy Policy of one of the other groups: [http://tinyurl.com/RG-Privacy](http://tinyurl.com/RG-Privacy). There has been instances of vulnerables peopleâ€™s details being added to open access spreadsheets so recording data in each sub group need to be discussed as a matter of priority. 

**Potential group roles**:

Ideas on allocating roles within the group to create better communication and structure:

Each role could be a small team or have at least one backup incase peopleâ€™s ability to volunteer changes suddenly. 

- Subgroup support request coordinators

- Policy lead (all can contribute/take advice from the central groups, but someone needs to update the resources as things change)

- Data lead

- Safeguarding lead

- Facebook comms leads (sharing info, responding to questions)

- WhatsApp comms leads

- Liaising with the voluntary sector including local charities, food banks etc. We may need to direct energy to the systems already in place to be as efficient as possible. 

**ACTION: If anyone would like to volunteer for a role, we could add you to a coordinators WhatsApp group (this hasnâ€™t been coordinating anything thus far just collating information!)**

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Potential Cultural Roles within meetings</span>**

Eg â€˜critical friendâ€™ of new proposals in meetings â€“ someone who holds in mind the values and ethos that PSC work by and how the new proposal/project

Eg historical context - perspective taker/bringer eg someone who brings historical context to a current proposal/working group etc

Eg new member (or â€˜futureâ€™) view â€“ brings perspective of a new member on what is being discussed 

Eg â€˜community listenerâ€™ â€“ what are other groups working on, whatâ€™s important to them? What do they want from us as PSC? How can we work together with other groups?
